# Point-of-Sales-Ordering-System
Information Technology becomes ever more prevalent in todayâ€™s world, characterised
by mobility, communication and connectivity. Information systems play a role in
enhancing operational efficiency and supporting decisions across all sectors.

As part of our final year major IT project, we were tasked with creating a _front end system_ and _website_, with reporting capabilities, for a business which will provide some form of value to their establishment/organisation.
These deliverables were developed under an iterative agile methodology, and presented in four major milestone presentations throughout the academic year.

We were able to have [Dimension Data](https://www.dimensiondata.com/) play the role of our client, and setup a case study surrounding a canteen within one of their branches.
> **Disclaimer:** This project is not associated with Dimension Data in any way, and is **not** to be considered a product of the company. Dimension Data simply played the role of our client.

### Brief overview of old canteen operation
Employees would head down to the canteen where they would place an order with
one of the available canteen staff members. The staff member would then look up the
pricing of those items and provide the employee with a receipt. The order would be
vocally relayed back to the chef and the employee would wait to receive their order.

### Main reasons underpinning the development of a new system
- Lengthy waiting times during peak hours
- Lack of decision making support surrounding aspects of the canteen
- No intergration of employee access cards or credit scheme
- Adherence to Covid-19 protocols
- General inefficincies resulting from mostly manual procedures

## Overview of the Front End System
<Insert front end system description - talk about the varibale views which should explain why we call it a point of sales ordering system and not just a POS system>

## Overview of the Website
The website allows features deemed appropriate of the front end-system to be portable allowing
users to access these functionalities on the go. This provides the Dimension Data employees a more
flexible and convenient way of placing their orders from the comfort of their work offices or current
surroundings. The main objective was to mobilise the ordering procedure.
