## About
Information Technology becomes ever more prevalent in todayâ€™s world, characterised
by mobility, communication and connectivity. Information systems play a role in
enhancing operational efficiency and supporting decisions across all sectors.

As part of our final year major IT project, we were tasked with creating a _front end system_ and _website_ for a business which will provide some form of value to their establishment/organisation. These systems are aimed to produce as much data as possible to present reports and support business intelligence.
These deliverables were developed under an iterative agile methodology and presented in four major milestone presentations throughout the academic year.

We were able to have an IT company  play the role of our client, and setup a case study surrounding a canteen within one of their branches.

### Brief overview of old canteen operation
Employees would head down to the canteen where they would place an order with
one of the available canteen staff members. The staff member would then look up the
pricing of those items and provide the employee with a receipt. The order would be
vocally relayed back to the chef and the employee would wait to receive their order.

<section id="problems">

### Main reasons underpinning the development of a new system
- Lengthy waiting times during peak hours
- Lack of decision making support surrounding aspects of the canteen
- No intergration of employee access cards or credit scheme
- Adherence to Covid-19 protocols
- General inefficincies resulting from mostly manual procedures

## Front-End System Overview
The front end system draws inspiration from kiosk stations, which is it's intended method of deployment within the canteen. It fully facilitates the ordering procedure for all employees, and multiple of these statitions can be setup in the canteen to eliminate lengthy queues. The system presents varaibale viewes, depending on the user group of the logged in user. This allows to system to additionally be deployed within the canteen's kitchen such that the pending orders along with their details are viewable to the logged in canteen staff members and they can begin working on servicing the order.

## Reporting Overview
Both systems generate plentiful data which can be used to create various reports to support smart decision making surrounding the various aspects of the canteen. Along with a traditional receipt and email confirmation upon placing an order, a dynamic reporting system was created in Power BI to display relevant information surrounding these areas namely: stock, canteen workers, sales, and credits.
